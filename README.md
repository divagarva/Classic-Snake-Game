# Snake-Game
 The Snake Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to score points by avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. The game features a Game Over screen displaying the final score and a restart button for replayability.
